its behalf a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license in the

****************************
This package includes a AD module/class implemented using 5 programing languages:
Fortran, C++, Java, Python, Julia.
To use this module, the noraml variables (e.g. double) should be declared as
the AD variable. 

NOTE: for each application the variable "dimmax" in the module should be set to the number
of variables to be differentiated!! 
There are 3 examples implemented using 5 languages so that users can see how the module
is used.
